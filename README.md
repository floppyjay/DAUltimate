DA ULTIMATE

The game is a survival horror action rpg game, with roguelike elements due to the random generation of each gameplay. Your main goal is to survive for as long as possible, which means you have to collect resources and prevent death from zombies by killing them with the various weapons and traps you can create. The most unique quality is the combination of fast-paced action with survival in a 2D environment with the infinite exploration of a strange world. Influences: pixel dungeon, nuclear throne, dark ascension originals, minceraft. Those shitty zombie survival games.
